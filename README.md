## What is Rosenblatt's Perceptron?

Rosenblatt perceptron is a binary single neuron model. The inputs integration is implemented through the addition of the weighted inputs that have fixed weights obtained during the training stage. If the result of this addition is larger than a given threshold θ the neuron fires. When the neuron fires its output is set to 1, otherwise it’s set to 0.
